"""Creating a thread: the one path every way of starting one goes through.

The assistant's ``start_thread`` and the user's own "New thread", send-as-thread
and "Continue in a thread" all create the link record and write what the thread
opens with here, so the seed always passes the boundary in
``family_assistant.threads.boundary``. What runs the first turn differs: a
thread the assistant starts is a delegation run, admitted by the target's
delegation policy, while a thread the user starts runs its first turn as the
user's own turn, like picking a profile.

See docs/design/one-thread-chat-ux.md, "Starting a thread".

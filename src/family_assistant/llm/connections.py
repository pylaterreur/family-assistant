"""SDK clients shared by every model client on the same provider endpoint.

A provider SDK client holds the expensive part of talking to a provider: an
HTTP connection pool bound to one endpoint and one credential. A model client
is a model name and its request parameters on top of one. Building an SDK
client per model client multiplied connection pools by every tier entry and
profile; borrowing from this registry keeps one per endpoint, however many
model clients use it.

The registry owns what it builds, so a model client that borrowed its SDK
client leaves closing it to the registry's owner.
